# wolfy-discord-bot
A simple bot to help you play werewolfes on discord. 

To make it work you will need a discord bot and save login credentials(TOKEN, GUILD) of the bot into .env file. For game you need to make .game_data.json which includes game rules, data about players etc. If I have time I will post the standard format excluding private information.
